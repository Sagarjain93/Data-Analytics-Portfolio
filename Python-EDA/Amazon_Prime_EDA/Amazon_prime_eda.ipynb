The data came from two separate CSV files — one with title-level information (title.csv) and the other containing crew/credits information (credits.csv). The goal was to derive meaningful insights about content trends, user ratings, genres, certifications, and more to understand what kind of content performs well on Amazon Prime.*\n",
